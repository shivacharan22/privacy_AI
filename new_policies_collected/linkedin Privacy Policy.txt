Introduction
* Data Controllers and Contracting Parties. We clarify the LinkedIn entity acting as the data controller and contracting party for the data of some of our Members and Visitors. LinkedIn Corporation will be the data controller and contracting party for those who live outside of the “Designated Countries” while LinkedIn Ireland Unlimited Company (“LinkedIn Ireland”) will remain the data controller for those that live in the Designated Countries.

Section 1 - Data We Collect
Section 1.1 - Data You Provide to Us
* Profile - We clarify that you are not obligated to provide us personal data beyond the limited data we need for you to register your account or to make payments if you purchase premium services from us. However, a complete profile helps you be found for economic opportunity and helps make the Services more relevant and useful to you.

Section 1.2 - Data from Others
