PRIVACY FAQ
In-game chat safety function
1. Introduction
 
We take your data privacy and security very seriously. We take steps to ensure that your content is stored and processed by us in a transparent way and using secure and reliable technology.
We understand that your trust is something we earn. As part of that process, we work to keep you informed of our data privacy policy and measures, as they may change over time.
This FAQ explains some common questions on a new feature for certain regions concerning chat in version 1.5.0 of PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE (“Game”), particularly for those users and prospective users who have questions about how we meet our requirements under data protection laws and other applicable regulations concerning data privacy.
For further information regarding our data privacy practices and this FAQ:
(a) Please review the PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE Privacy Policy – which sets out how we collect, store and process your personal data to provide you with the Game, and the End-user License Agreement for PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS MOBILE.
(b) Please contact our privacy team via email at dpo@proximabeta.com should you have any further questions.
2. What is the in-game chat safety function?
 
To ensure the Game provides a safe platform for users of the Game, we have introduced an in-Game chat safety function (“Safety Feature”) in certain regions. The Safety Feature will help us to improve your experience of the Game by flagging users who use chat function in violation of our End-user License Agreement. For countries where the law requires that we have a legal basis for processing certain data, we operate the Safety Feature in our legitimate interests to ensure the safety and integrity of our Game. The Safety Feature works to identify, for example, unsolicited commercial communications, including plug-in sales and advertising, spam, harmful communication, exploits, bullying, harassment, threats of violence or conduct which is hateful, harassing, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, humiliating, threatening, profane or similarly objectionable (“Prohibited Conduct”).
3. What are the consequences for users who engage in Prohibited Conduct?
 
All users are required to comply with our End-user License Agreement, and you should familiarize yourself with your obligations as part of our gaming community. In order to ensure a safe gaming environment for our users we may take action against users who violate the End-user License Agreement or otherwise engage in Prohibited Conduct, which may include limiting use of those features that have been abused.
4. How can I use the Safety Feature and how does it work?
 
When you observe a user engaging in Prohibited Conduct, you can press the “Report” button on the screen if this feature is available in your region. This will record a short snippet of the chat and convert it into text (the audio itself is not retained). The text may be automatically translated if needed. Please note that the Safety Feature is only available on Spawn Island before the battle begins while playing the Game’s classic game mode.
5. What if I think I have been implicated by mistake?
 
We have implemented safeguards to ensure any consequences are appropriate and proportionate to the relevant Prohibited Conduct and the frequency with which such Prohibited Conduct has occurred.
We will notify you if you have been muted, as a result of your breach of the End-User License Agreement. If you think your account was muted by mistake, please contact us at service@pubgmobile.com to request a review.
6. Do you warn users before taking action?
 
We may not issue a warning before muting you but we will notify you if you have been muted.
7. Do you store chats and where do you store them?
 
No. The Safety Feature is designed to protect your privacy. We therefore do not store any chats of any user. We also do not store chats as part of the translation process. Documented version of the chat is not stored, except where it provides evidence of Prohibited Conduct by a user. In these cases we store the documented version of the chat as evidence on our servers in the United States and Singapore and subsequently automatically delete it in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
8. Do you share chats with any third parties?
 
We do not share any chats of any user with any third party, except where necessary for the translation process or in exceptional circumstances, such as where we believe we are legally required to (for example, if we are subject to a court order for disclosure), or where we need to do so in order to enforce or protect your rights, our rights or the rights of other users. Please consult our Privacy Policy for further details.
9. Can I object to your processing of my chats?
 
Yes. If you are a resident of a relevant country as noted in our Privacy Policy, you may have the right to object to, and seek restriction of, our processing of your chats for this purpose. To exercise your right, please contact us at dpo@proximabeta.com and please consult the Privacy Policy for further information.
We will consider several factors when assessing an objection, including: our users' reasonable expectations; the benefits and risks to you, us, or other users as a result of our implementation of the Safety Feature; and other available means to achieve the same purpose the Safety Feature achieves that may be less invasive and do not require disproportional effort. Unless the processing is based on our compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons, your objection will be upheld and we will cease processing your information.
10. Is the Safety Feature secure and how do you comply with data protection laws?
 
We have a comprehensive global privacy program directed at protecting your personal data. You can read about how we process and protect personal data in our Privacy Policy. We also use a variety of security technologies and procedures for the purpose of preventing loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure of your information.
11. How do you respond to law enforcement requests for chat information?
 
We may, from time to time, receive law enforcement requests to disclose your chat information (and its translation) to regulators, courts or law enforcement bodies. When we receive these requests, we take reasonable steps to query them and establish whether or not we are legally required to respond to them. When we are legally required to respond to such a request, we will take measures to safeguard your legal rights and your personal data.
